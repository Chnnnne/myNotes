  **Hello! everyone**.
  
  This is all my notes when I study **C++, Java, algorithm and so on**. You can see that there is not only markdown files but some pdf, photos or source code I collect from other sources.
  
  So this repository will be updated continuously untill I stop learning when I think that's the time of my death. hh.
  
  Thanks for ❤**Ms.Zhang Yujia**❤ for pointing out my grammer mistakes. Love ya forever!
