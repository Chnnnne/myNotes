  **Hello! everyone**.
  
  This is all my notes when I study **C++, Java, algorithm, ML, DL and so on**. You can see that there is not only markdown files but some pdf, photos or source code I collect from other sources.
  
  So this repository will be updated continuously untill I stop learning when I think that's the time of my death. hh.
  
  Thanks ❤**Ke JI**❤ for being my GF and support me. Love ya forever!
